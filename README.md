## SMX - Frontend

The purpose of this project is to implement a desktop and mobile web application to facilitate the exchange of used textbooks within a post-secondary institution. This application will allow users to search for a textbook they wish to purchase or post an advertisement for a textbook they wish to sell.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/samcodrington/smx-frontend/wiki) for more details.

This application uses a backend database application, called [smx-backend](https://github.com/samcodrington/smx-backend/wiki)
